<p>The malwareidentifier script present in this repository is suplementary code to an evalutative report into the physical impacts of malware on device hardware. The script can be run within the PowerShell ISE and functions by obtaining the executing devices CPU temperature and comparing it the 'normal' operational temperature of this type of component. It also obtains and returns key aspects of the devices BIOS information to enable the executor to review components such as installation date and thus identifiy whether it is likely an unauthroised BIOS change has occured.</p>
<P>Were I to alter this code, I would like to explore the ability to check voltage being output or delivered by certain componets as this was an additional telltale sign of malware presence I have not checked in the code. <br> I may also attempt to improve the appearance of the interface making it more visually appealing for a user.</p>
